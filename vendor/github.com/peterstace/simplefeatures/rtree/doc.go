// Package rtree implements an in-memory r-tree data structure. This data
// structure can be used as a spatial index, allowing fast spatial searches
// based on a bounding box.
//
// The implementation is heavily based on "R-Trees. A Dynamic Index Structure
// For Spatial Searching" by Antonin Guttman (which can be found at
// http://www-db.deis.unibo.it/courses/SI-LS/papers/Gut84.pdf).
